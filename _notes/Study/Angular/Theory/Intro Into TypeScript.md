### _Typescript Intro_:

- It's a superset of JS (JS + more)
- Compiles to plain JS by the typescript compiler.
- Includes many ES6 features.
- Static Typing
- Object class (it's just syntactic sugar to make it feel like an actual OOPS language)
- Modules
- let/const scoping

---

### _Typescript Compiler_:

- Written in typescript
- Compiles .ts files to .js
- Install with npm
- Supports ES6 + Syntax
- Used by angular

---

### _What is `static type checking`_:

- As we know JS is a dynamic language. 
 <br>
- We use `var` and assign types dynamically.
  This can be a boon and a curse sometimes. Typescript provides us an option to have static type checking by pre-assigning types to variables.
