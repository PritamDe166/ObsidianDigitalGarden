Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) can quickly generate angular applications, services, and components.

### **Dependencies:**
- Node JS (JS Runtime)
- NPM (JS package manager)

---
### **Installation:**
- Node JS
- Visual Studio Code(IDE)

---

### **Steps:**
- Go to the `terminal` (either PowerShell/GitHub)
- You now need to install the Angular CLI which is the runtime environment for Angular.
- Next, we need to go to the directory where we need to create our project.
- This will create the folder structures, required packages, and default files for our application “App3”.
- Now let's go inside our application folder.
- This will open up the dev server but it won't open the application in the browser. We need to navigate to the Url.
- We can also use `ng serve --open` which will directly launch the application in the hosted port.
